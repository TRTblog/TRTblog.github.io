Ken, the creative mind behind the “Totally Random Thoughts”, is a self-proclaimed geek with a deep-seated love for modern science fiction classics such as “Star Trek”, "Ghostbusters" and “Transformers.”

A devoted fan of authors Robert L. Forward, John Gribbin, Brian Greene and Alvin Toffler, his passion for science fiction and non-fiction knows no bounds. His interests are not limited to literature, as he is deeply fascinated by astronomy, astrophysics, and the vast unknown. Ken’s curiosity doesn’t stop there; it extends to meteorology, paleontology, and the dynamic realm of technology, where he takes pleasure in computer programming.

In 2017, Ken found a new dimension of peace and purpose when he embraced his faith and was baptized as a Roman Catholic. Ken’s fascination extends to the rich tapestry of biblical history and its profound influence on modern civilization. He holds the conviction that science and religion are not mutually exclusive but rather complementary forces. This belief in the harmonious coexistence of science and religion is a testament to Ken’s multifaceted approach to exploring the unknown and the mysterious through the blog.

Ken’s thirst for adventure doesn’t end there; he is an avid explorer of the unknown, delving into the mysteries of ghosts, Sasquatch, aliens, and other paranormal phenomena. Inspired by the legendary explorer Josh Gates, Ken’s explorations fuel the diverse and intriguing content of “Totally Random Thoughts,” making it a hub for those who seek to understand the unexplained.
